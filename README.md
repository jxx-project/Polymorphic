# Polymorphic â€” safely derive from C++ standard containers

## Problem

C++ containers like `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map` are non-polymorphic by design, first of all by relying on template member functions. These cannot be virtual and therefore cannot be overridden in a polymorphic way.

This first limitation wouldn't necessarily stop us from adding new behaviour (i.e. new member functions) to container subclasses in a polymorphic way, while still exposing the well known non-polymorphic container interfaces. Just refrain from overriding the non-virtuals!

Another limitation, standard containers' lack of virtual destructors, is a show stopper. We can easily subclass C++ containers directly. When such an object is deleted via a base class pointer, however, bad things happen, ranging from memory leaks to heap corruption.

## The idea behind Polymorphic decorators

is very simple but effective. They

 * compose C++ container class template delegates with the same set of template parameters,
 * provide 1-by-1 forwarding non-virtual inline members and member templates, reference type conversions, constructors, assignment operators, and
 * add a virtual destructor!

## Modern C++ features

 * Can be used almost interchangeably with C++11 standard containers.
 * Implicit conversions allow transparent substitution of one for the other almost everywhere, except as pointer targets.
 * Move semantics, rvalue references.

Decorator pattern is cool and old school. Typing hundreds of forwarding members is neither cool nor fun, but a one time task. Fortunately, C++ library standards, while evolving, do not alter signatures of existing public container members.

## Performance impact

### Read and update

None, assuming compilers manage to collapse inline decorator members into the delegate container operations.

### Create and delete

Adds the cost for setting the hidden vtable pointer per decorator instance on creation, and the check for subclass destructors on deletion.

### Memory footprint

Adds one hidden vtable pointer per decorator instance, compared to the raw container.

## Testing

The Polymorphic package is harnessed with a set of test suite templates located in namespace `Testee`. Main focus is template member signatures and return types, but also includes basic plausibility checks of results.

Using test suite templates solved the "test the tester" dilemma. Running tests against the delegate, i.e. the C++ standard library implementation, helped developing and verifying test suites. Then they are used to verify that decorators are actually providing the same interface.

## How to use

Polymorphic decorators are a headers-only library. You may just copy the `include/Polymorphic` directory into a location found by your build system.

CMakeLists.txt files are only required to build and run the test suites.

### Linux

```
./configure
make
make test
```

### Windows

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

will create a Visual Studio solution building the test executables.
